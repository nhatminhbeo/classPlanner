# classPlanner

As a current UCSD student, I feel that the resources about majors, classes, requirements are abundant, yet unorganized,
disconnected and sometimes unreachable, making my college planning such a painful work.

Therefore, I have decided to create a user-friendly, informative and most importantly easy to use class planner for UCSD
students. The project, however, if becomes successful, would be further developed to aid students in other schools as well.

I plan to first, scrap the data of classes, majors, requirements and create a coherent database of them using python and SQL.
Then, we will start to work on the front-end drag-and-drop user interface with helpful features so each student can build
their plan in just a few minutes.

If you are interested in contributing to the project, please fire me a message @ mtranquo@ucsd.edu
Even though anyone is welcomed, we are currently looking for partners with experience in web dev and mobile dev.
